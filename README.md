# TODO

* Add web-api to allow interactions via REST
* Record time spent within each fn, adjust threads to take adv
* Detect cyclic graphs
* Named relationships
* Allow connecting components to named relationships
* Put in retry for processors

# QUESTIONS

* Is there a better way to have mandatory fields traits than fns? e.g. pause mutex
* Do I need to clone everything to use within threads
