# TODO

* Support multiple threads on each component
* Support stopping and starting each component
* Support queueing on connections
* Add web-api to allow interactions via REST
* Record time spent within each fn, adjust threads to take adv

# QUESTIONS

* Is there a better way to have mandatory fields traits than fns? e.g. pause mutex
* Do I need to clone everything to use within threads
